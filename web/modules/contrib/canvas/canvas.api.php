/**
 * @defgroup canvas_architecture Drupal Canvas Architecture
 * @{
 *
 * @section prop_expressions Prop Expressions
 *
 * Since instantiated components in:
 * - content type templates
 * - content entities
 * must be able to map values from structured data (field props) into component
 * props, and many APIs and layers are involved in doing this:
 * - correctly
 * - securely
 * - performant
 * It seems sensible to use a strongly typed approach to representing these
 * expressions.
 *
 * Furthermore, the Drupal Canvas UX must make it easy to surface viable
 * matches from the structured data that can fit in the components, as well as
 * the other way around.
 *
 * Therefore a base expression interface is provided, which guarantees a
 * stringable representation (simplifying both debugging as well as storing
 * these expressions), *and* the conversion back.
 * In other words: every possible expression used by Drupal Canvas can
 * always be converted from string to PHP object and vice versa.
 *
 * String representations of prop expressions probing into:
 * - components will always start with the symbol `⿲`
 * - structured data will always start with the symbol `ℹ`
 *
 *
 * String and storage representation of expressions referencing field types,
 * field instances, fields aka field item lists, field deltas aka field items,
 * field item properties:
 * - `␟` is the field item VS property name separator, because a field property
 *   is the smallest unit
 * - `␞` then is the field item list vs field item separator
 * - `␝` then is the field item list vs field item separator
 * - `␜` then is the entity vs field item list separator
 *

 * @see https://github.com/SixArm/usv
 *
 *
 * @section canvas_extensions Canvas Extensions
 *
 * Canvas Extensions makes additional functionalities and customization points
 * available for extending the Drupal Canvas module.
 *
 * Canvas Extensions can only be defined in modules. Themes are not supported.
 *
 * Any library with `drupalSettings.canvasExtension` will be identified as an
 * Drupal Canvas extension and will be loaded with the UI. Be sure
 * to add `canvas/ui` as a dependency.
 * So, your `*.libraries.yml` file should contain an entry that looks similar to this:
 * @code
 * app:
 *  header: true
 *  js:
 *    path/to/your/canvas/extension/something.js:
 *      attributes: { type: module }
 *  drupalSettings:
 *    canvasExtension:
 *      testExtension: {
 *        id: 'canvas-test-extension',
 *        name: 'Canvas Test Extension',
 *        description: 'A test extension for Drupal Canvas.',
 *        imgSrc: 'relative/path/from/your/module/optionalImage.png'
 *      }
 *  dependencies:
 *    - canvas/canvas-ui
 *
 * @see tests/modules/canvas_test_extension_legacy/ui/index.jsx for how to wrap your
 * React Application so it has access to Drupal Canvas UI APIs
 * @see tests/modules/canvas_test_extension_legacy/ui/components/ConceptProver.jsx for
 * examples of how these APIs can be used to access info about and make
 * changes to content in the UI.
 *
 * This functionality is currently experimental and a more formal API will be available in future versions.
