name: 'Test Block Components to simulate an input schema change'
description: We can't modify the canvas_test_block module to execute a real schema update. The
  way to execute a real schema update is to install a v2 of the same module and
  execute a hook_update. This can't be done with the current infrastructure, but
  we can simulate it with a second module, canvas_test_block_simulate_input_schema_change.
  This second module, when enabled, brings a different schema for the block plugin
  canvas_test_block_input_schema_change_poc, and with this new schema we can simulate
  and test if the updates of the schema can fail or not.
